The following files were converted from an import that was stored lossy.
You may lose fidelity when re-importing these files upon loading the project.
res://.godot/imported/icon.svg-218a8f2b3041327d8a5756f3a245f83b.ctex to res://.assets/icon.png
------

The following files were converted and saved to a non-original path, but did not have their import data rewritten.
These files will not be re-imported when loading the project.
res://.godot/imported/icon.svg-218a8f2b3041327d8a5756f3a245f83b.ctex to res://.assets/icon.png
------

The following files were not converted because support has not been implemented yet:
res://.godot/imported/orbs.ogg-65cad2492f5fe80dff814753a77a66fa.oggvorbisstr
res://.godot/imported/04B_11__.TTF-8e1ca7a6f0f5d6c046ca3e5cdbddd686.fontdata



---------------------------------IMPORTANT NOTES----------------------------------

The following resource types were detected in the project that conversion is not implemented for yet:
Type: AudioStreamOggVorbis	Format: ogg
Type: FontFile            	Format: ttf
See Export Report to see which resources were not exported.
You will still be able to edit the project in the editor regardless.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use Godot editor version 4.0 to edit the project.
Note: the project may be using a custom version of Godot. Detection for this has not been implemented yet.
If you find that you have many non-import errors upon opening the project 
(i.e. scripts or shaders have many errors), use the original game's binary as the export template.

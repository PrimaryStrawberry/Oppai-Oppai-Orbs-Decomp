This is a Decompilation and Enhancement of Oppai Oppai Orbs! You can find the game [Here](https://inksgirls.itch.io/orbs)(NSFW warning) , **I did not make this.** all credit goes to [@inksgirls](https://inksgirls.itch.io/) on itch.io.

### Compiling from Source

This game compiles on Godot version 4.1+ (as of 11/3/2023)
along with android sdk, and opensdk for android compilation.

### Notes

the apk will give you permission warnings, its safe to ignore it. (or just build it from the source)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you have a cool feature idea please share it, I can do just about anything **except adding more art!**

## Enhanced Version Features:

- Increase Bust Button
- Reset Bust Button
- Breast Size Interpolation Mode | this is quite difficult

### planned features:

- More accurate meter in Interpolation Mode

## How I did this

I found a tool called [gdsdecomp.](https://github.com/bruvzg/gdsdecomp)
It decompiles unencrypted Godot games.
after decompiling I just kinda booted it up and tested it out.

if you do not want your games decompiled, read the [godot docs here](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/contributing/development/compiling/compiling_with_script_encryption_key.html)
